# shopping_list

This shopping list web application is a project that aims to offer a practical solution to a common problem we face in Venezuela,
which is to keep track of the total amount of money you need to spend when you're in a supermarket for example, because here (at this moment at least)
prices are expressed in our local currency (Bolivares) and USD which could be calculated at different exchange rates depending on the store you're in.

Product prices could be labeled in Bolivares or in USD, this makes it difficult for people to know exactly how much they
need to pay.

## App features

The app allow you to set the exchange rate, add products in Bs and USD, add weighted products as veggies and all items are
showed below in Bs where you are able to delete them if you want. If you have some products in the list and you change the
exchange rate all prices of products which were added in USD will automatically update and the products which were added in
Bs will not be affected by the exchage rate update.

Web app created with ðŸ’“ to my mom, I hope it could be helpful to other people as well.

I will not longer add any other feature to this project, instead soon I will start a new one with some additional cool stuff.
